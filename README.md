# Med Tracks
Log and set reminders for your medications.

https://medtracks.netlify.app/



## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React
My goal for this project was to create a React application that allowed users to track and log their medications. 

## Optimizations
To improve this project I would allow users to be able to switch to a dark theme. If had the time, I would convert this into a fullstack application using a databse.

## Lessons Learned:
I was able to implement React useState as well as hooks in order to store the data into local storage.
